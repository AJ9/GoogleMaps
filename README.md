# GoogleMaps


A basic XCode project including a working google maps demo.

The full Google Maps walkthrough can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start), but for a quick start download this project and add your Google Maps API key see [Usage](https://github.com/AJ9/GoogleMaps#usage). 

# Usage

You need to add your own Google Maps API Key to this project! This is done changing this line in the **AppDelegate.m** to include your Google Maps iOS key.

`NSString * GoogleMapsAPIKey = @"YOUR-KEY";`

An example might look like: 


`NSString * GoogleMapsAPIKey = @"BGzaSyAbfNKVd_EWpC-f2TjGBoCX17tc6PQm4-k";`
